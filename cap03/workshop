# 1)	Write a regular expression that matches a floating-point
# 	number (a number with a decimal point) such as 3.14. There
# 	can be digits on either side of the decimal point, but there
# 	need not be any on one side or the other. Allow the regex to
# 	match just a decimal point by itself, too

[0-9]*\.[0-9]*

# 2)	Use a back reference in a regular expression to match a number that appears on
#	both sides of an equals sign. For example, it should match “314 is = to 314” but
#	not “6 = 7.”

([0-9]+).*=.*\1

# 3)	Write a regular expression that looks for a line that begins with a digit and ends
#	with a digit, with anything occurring in between.

^[0-9]*[0-9]

# 4)	Write a regular expression that uses grouping to match on the following two IP
#	addresses: 10.0.0.25 and 10.0.0.134.

10\.0\.0\.(25|134)
